## Project Description
I was tasked with refactoring the code of a pre-existing website so that it uses a fully functioning Google Books API search engine build with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.
